This is the repository for [Retool's](https://unexpectedpanda.github.io/retool/) clone
list and metadata files. It also hosts `config/internal-config.json` and `datafile.dtd`.

## Contributions

### Clone lists

Contributions are welcome. Before submitting a PR, make sure to read about
[how clone lists work and should be structured](https://unexpectedpanda.github.io/retool/contribute-clone-lists/). Make sure your changes are formatted correctly, tested, and
that `clonelists/hash.json` is updated accordingly.

### Metadata files

Metadata files are auto-generated from Redump and No-Intro databases, and should not be
manually updated.
